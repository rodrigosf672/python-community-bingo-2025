# Python Community Bingo 2025

Welcome to the Python Community Bingo!

This project is a small, heart-warming initiative designed to celebrate the incredible experiences we share within the Python community. As we approach the end of the year, it is a perfect time to reflect on the events, the learning, and the friendships that make this ecosystem so special.

## Our Goal

The primary goal of this application is to encourage support for the Python Software Foundation (PSF). The PSF is the non-profit organization that makes Python possible, supporting the language, the infrastructure, and the diverse community we all love.

We hope that while you enjoy marking off squares like "Attended a Python local meetup" or "Helped someone learn Python," you will feel inspired to give back.

**Please consider donating to the PSF today:** <https://donate.python.org/>

## How to Play

1.  Open the application in your browser.
2.  Review the 5x5 grid of community achievements.
3.  Click on squares that you have accomplished this year.
4.  If you complete a row, column, or diagonal, you get a Bingo!
5.  Share your card with friends and colleagues to spread the word.

## Disclaimer

This is a community-created project and is **not** officially affiliated with the Python Software Foundation. It was built with love by community members who simply want to support the ecosystem.

## Running Locally

Because this application uses PyScript, it requires a local web server to function correctly (due to browser security policies regarding local files).

To run it on your machine:

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3.  Run the following command:
    
    `python3 -m http.server 8000`

4.  Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have ideas for new bingo squares, improvements to the code, or just want to fix a typo, please feel free to contribute.

Thank you for being part of the Python community. Here is to another wonderful year of coding and collaboration!

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Whether you’d like to suggest new bingo squares for future years, improve the code, adjust the wording, or fix a small typo, feel free to jump in.

## Personal Note

This is my small gift to the Python community.

I hope it brings a smile to your face and helps you reflect on the memories and experiences that shaped your year. I’ll be mostly offline until January 4, 2026, but please don’t hesitate to open issues or contribute in any way.

In particular, I’d love ideas or contributions that help make this project or future versions/iterations more encouraging and effective in supporting donations to the PSF.

Thank you for being part of this community, and here’s to another year of learning and building together.
